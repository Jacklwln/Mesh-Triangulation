A mesh triangulation class.  Takes a set of points and creates a triangular mesh through them.  

This was made for learning purposes, feel free to use this however you want.  I claim no responsiblity for it.

I used two pieces of code written by others:

1) A kdtree structure ( http://code.google.com/p/kdtree/ ), which I slightly modified to make it a header-only file.

2) A svg drawing class ( http://code.google.com/p/simple-svg/ ).
